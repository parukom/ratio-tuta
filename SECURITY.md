## 🛡️ Security Features

Ratio Tuta implements multiple layers of security protection:

### Authentication & Sessions
- ✅ **Secure Sessions:** `__Host-` prefix cookies with HMAC signatures
- ✅ **Password Security:** bcrypt hashing (12 rounds) + HIBP breach checking
- ✅ **Email Verification:** Required for account activation
- ✅ **Password Requirements:** 8-128 characters with complexity checks

### Data Protection
- ✅ **Email Encryption:** AES-256-GCM encryption at rest with HMAC indexing
- ✅ **HTTPS Only:** Strict Transport Security (HSTS) with 2-year max-age
- ✅ **Secure File Uploads:** Presigned S3 URLs with size/type validation (5MB max)

### Attack Prevention
- ✅ **CSRF Protection:** Stateless HMAC-based tokens on all state-changing operations
- ✅ **Rate Limiting:** Distributed rate limiting via Upstash Redis
  - Authentication: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
  - API: Sliding window algorithm
- ✅ **XSS Protection:** Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- ✅ **Clickjacking Protection:** X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- ✅ **SQL Injection Protection:** Parameterized queries via Prisma ORM

### Monitoring & Auditing
- ✅ **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logging of security-sensitive actions
- ✅ **Error Handling:** No sensitive data leaked in error messages
- ✅ **IP Tracking:** User-agent and IP logging for security events

## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Self-Hosting

If you're deploying Ratio Tuta yourself, follow these security guidelines:

### Environment Configuration

1. **Generate Strong Secrets**
   ```bash
   # Generate cryptographically secure secrets (32+ bytes)
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
   ```

2. **Required Environment Variables**
   - `SESSION_SECRET` - Min 32 chars, random
   - `HMAC_SECRET` - Min 32 chars, random
   - `CRYPTO_KEY` - Exactly 32 bytes, random

3. **Never Commit Secrets**
   - Keep `.env` files in `.gitignore`
   - Use environment variables or secret managers
   - Rotate secrets regularly

### Production Deployment

- ✅ **Use HTTPS:** Always enable HTTPS in production (automatic with Vercel)
- ✅ **Enable Redis:** Use Upstash Redis for distributed rate limiting
- ✅ **Database Security:** Use connection pooling (PgBouncer) and SSL
- ✅ **Monitor Logs:** Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity
- ✅ **Update Dependencies:** Run `npm audit` regularly
- ✅ **Backup Database:** Regular automated backups with encryption
